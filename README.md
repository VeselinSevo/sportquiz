# SportQuiz - sport quiz for sport lovers

Built with React

## Game Objective:

Goal in this game, as in every quiz based game is to have fun. Also, it's not bad to have the most correct answers. The user can play game with random difficulty questions generated all together, or choose which difficulty suits him the best. After that, player selects answers that he thinks are correct and after clicking "Check Questions" button he gets number of correctly answered questions. Also at that time app displays to user what are right and wrong answers so he can see what he got right/wrong and learn something. 

## My goal building this game:
With building this game, my goal was, to better understand and practice core features of React, such as Hooks(useState, useEffect, useRef), conditional rendering, passing of the props beetween components, making API calls(fetching data) and then mapping and manipulating gotten data to shape it in the way we need for the application.
